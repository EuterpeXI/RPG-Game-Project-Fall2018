# RPG-Game-Project-Fall2018
Course: CMPT 330;

Languages: C# (in Unity)

The objective of this project was to design a RPG styled game as a team and implement various elements (e.g. AI, swarm, collisions, controllers, sensors, etc...). The game was required to have a story for at least one completed level. 

Worked in a team of 5 to create an open world RPG styled game with multiple objectives outlined to progress through a post-apocalyptic story line.

Resulted in a finished working demo of a gaming but we had to cut down on the number of features we had planned to include initially due to complications.
Some complications included busy schedules, members who did not contribute as much and learning curves.
